	abstract = {Wine is a heterogeneous, information-rich offering, with a plethora of brands in the market. Knowledge of wines amidst such diversity understandably varies. In addition, some offer opinions on wine while others seek them. Yet, the interplay between opinion leadership and opinion seeking, on the one hand, and wine knowledge, both objective and subjective, has received little attention by wine marketing researchers. Thus, this paper explores the relationships between opinion leadership and opinion seeking among wine consumers, and investigates whether objective and subjective knowledge varies between opinion leaders and seekers. An online survey was used to collect data on the four constructs and correlation analysis was undertaken to investigate the relationships between them. Key findings indicate that those who tend to seek opinions about wine tend not to have high objective knowledge of wine, as may be expected. On the other hand, opinion leaders think that they know about wine, and generally are objectively knowledgeable. Thus, their influence on others is not only based on communication, but on fact, representing a valuable source of influence for wine marketers. Understanding target consumers’ wine knowledge levels can potentially impact every aspect of wine marketing strategy.},

	abstract = {Today, wine and tourism are two complementary resources defined by the context of the area: by the region’s conditions for regulating and certifying wine that form the basis for the demarcated region, and because tourism, in this field, is intimately linked to the design and attraction of the destination for tourists. One example of the symbiotic relationship between the two sectors is the Douro Valley (Portugal), which includes the first demarcated, regulated region in the world. It produces world-renowned wines and its landscape has been classified by UNESCO as Heritage of Humanity. The Douro area is marked by development based on the territorial framework applied to the region and its functioning is structured around “Quintas” (estates). These estates are the basic production units and are the result of a historic, social, economic, cultural and organizational process. Wine tourism in the Douro region is more than a specific reason to make the journey, prompted by wine; it is a new business opportunity and a catalyst for the region’s economy. Linked to the World Centre of Excellence for Destinations, the Douro is considered a “rural, natural destination of discovery” based on its success in wine tourism and the design of its wine routes. This success is aided by the reputation of the region’s wine, the organization of the wineries and the welcome given to visitors, as well as the stimulation and promotion of endogenous features and the creation of a range of services, attractions and events that complement the wineries and qualify the region as a tourist product integrated into a cultural framework.},

	abstract = {Recently, New Zealand's wine industry has made remarkable progress. For example,
the number of hectares planted in grapes increased from 4,880 in 1990, to 15,479 in
2003, and the number of wineries increased from 175 in 1993 to 421 in 2003.
Projections for 2006 indicate that the growth of wine exports should nearly double
from 2003, with expected revenues of \$NZ 736 million.
However, despite this growth, little has been reported about developments in New
Zealand's wine tourism industry, or about consumer perceptions of the winery
experience in the form of published academic research. The limited amount of
information, particularly from the visitors' points of view, may not only be preventing
winery operators and the wine industry in general from having a better understanding
of their visitors, but also from addressing the needs of different visitor segments.
Resulting implications for winery operators may include forgone business
opportunities, and customers not fully benefiting in terms of product and service
quality. Recent studies indicate that this last element is particularly important in wine tourism.
This study reports the results of an exploratory research project conducted in New
Zealand wineries that investigated aspects of the winery experience, including wine
involvement, satisfaction with the winery experience, and visitor demographics. An
index to measure involvement with wine, the wine involvement index (WIX), was
developed and utilised to investigate whether wine involvement had an impact on
winery visitors' behaviour.
Data were collected from winery visitors via questionnaires distributed in a sample of
wineries in different wine regions of New Zealand. A total of 609 usable responses
were obtained (24.8\% response rate). The results indicate a number of differences
between the independent, dependent, and moderating variables. For example, it was
found that age, whether visitors are domestic or international, and different levels of
wine involvement appear to have a clear impact on winery expenditure. In addition,
the WIX was confirmed to be a useful tool, for example, by identifying potential
relationships between different groups of winery visitors.
The results add new knowledge to the area of wine tourism, and offer useful
information for wineries and the wine tourism industry. This information includes the
potential commercial significance of some visitor groups. An additional contribution
of this study is the 'complete wine tourism research model.' This concept presents an
alternative to existing wine tourism models, and points out attributes and dimensions
that play a major role in the winery experience.},

	abstract = {This study investigated the perceptions and preferences of Australian wine consumers towards different styles of sparkling wine, including French Champagne and Australian sparkling white, red and rosé wine, Moscato and Prosecco. An online survey of 1027 regular sparkling wine consumers captured demographic information, sparkling wine perceptions and preferences, and typical spending and consumption patterns. Consumers were segmented into three distinct clusters (‘No Frills’, ‘Aspirants’ and ‘Enthusiasts’) using the Fine Wine Instrument model. The majority of No Frills consumers were female and typically consumed sparkling wine once per month. Almost 55\% of Aspirants were male with a household income of more than AU\$75,000. Enthusiast consumers were also predominantly male and well educated, and 64\% were under the age of 35 years. Sparkling white wine and Champagne were generally the preferred styles for each consumer group, followed by Moscato and sparkling rosé wine. Interestingly, Moscato scored favorably with both No Frills and Enthusiast segments. Almost 25\% of respondents indicated that they were not familiar with Prosecco, while sparkling red wine was perceived similarly by male and female consumers. The findings from this study can be used by sparkling wine producers to better target their products and marketing to the specific needs and expectations of consumers within different segments of the Australian domestic market.},
